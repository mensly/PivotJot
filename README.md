# PivotJot for Pivotal Tracker

I wanted to the ability to quickly jot down new Pivotal Tracker stories into 
the Icebox while out away from my computer. I found the mobile experience on 
the website pretty poor, and other apps weren't quite suitable for my use 
case. This app is an extremely simple application of the 
[Pivotal Tracker API](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/api) for a simple 
purpose. Learning how to interface with their API was also a goal of this 
project, in case I decide to work on a more full-fledged Android client at 
a later date. The source code has a very permissive license, so feel free 
to modify it to suit your own purposes.

If you're looking for a more feature-complete Android client for Pivotal 
Tracker, I'd recommend [P-Tracking](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sdw.pivotprojects).
 However, it is quite out of date and can't do everything the desktop client can.

A compiled version of this app can be found on [Google Play](http://bit.ly/pivotjot).
